      <dt>Goal</dt>
      <dd>
        In this last step of the cube, the ultimate goal is to complete the
        entire the cube ( in technical terms, this is called PLL, a shorthand
        for permute last layer. ).

      <dt>Complete the headlights</dt>

      <dd>
        <p>
          The first substep is to complete the corners or make all four sides
          have “headlights”. In order to do so, you have to first find
          “headlights” of the cube that looks something like this:
        </p>
        <img
          alt="Image of me holding a cube with up to OLL stage completed. and with my two fingers pointing at the matching colors of two corners forming a shaped of 'headlights' in its PLL stage"
          src="../pll_headlights.jpg"
          style="width: 50%; height: auto; display: block"
        />
        <p>
          It does not matter which color is in the middle or which color the
          headlight is, it just has to form a headlight, with the colors of two
          corners facing towards you having the same color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on the number of headlights, you can end up in different
          cases:
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Case 1). 0 Headlight (no headlights on all four sides)</dt>

      <dd>
        <video
          controls
          aria-label="Video demonstrating the algorithm to execute during PLL stage of solving a cube with CFOP beginner's method, when there are no headlights on all four sides"
          src="../pll_no_headlights.mp4"
          style="width: 50%; height: auto"
        ></video>
      </dd>

      <dt>Case 2). 1 Headlight (headlight on one side only)</dt>

      <dd>
        <video
          controls
          aria-label="Video demonstrating the algorithm to execute during PLL stage of solving a cube with CFOP beginner's method, when there is only 1 headlight on one side"
          src="../pll_one_headlight.mp4"
          style="width: 50%; height: auto"
        ></video>
      </dd>

      <dt>Case 3). 4 Headlights (headlights on all four sides)</dt>

      <dd>=> You are lucky, you can skip this substep.</dd>

      <dt>Complete the edges/rest of the cube</dt>
      <dd>
        The final substep is to complete the rest of the cube. Once you have
        completed the headlights, there are only 4 cases you can encounter. For
        each of these 4 cases, there is a corresponding algorithm with which you
        can solve the cube. Examine the cube, then execute the corresponding
        algorithm.
      </dd>

      <dt>Case 1). “Side stickers swapped”</dt>

      <dt>Case 2). “Opposite stickers swapped”</dt>

          style="width: 50%; height: auto"
        ></video>
      </dd>

      <dt>Case 3). “1 bar completed + Clockwise swapped”</dt>

          style="width: 50%; height: auto"
        ></video>
      </dd>

      <dt>Case 4). “1 bar completed + Counter-clockwise swapped”</dt>

    <p>
      Congratulations. Now you have solved your first cube! While there seems to
      be a lot of algorithms to memorize, with enough practice you will be able
      to memorize them all. In fact, since this algorithm is based on the CFOP
      method, if you have mastered the concepts here you will be able to
      naturally progress towards the full CFOP method. If you are interested in
      further learning, refer to the following article to learn more about the
      full CFOP method:
