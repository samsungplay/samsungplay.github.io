    <p><strong>Self Introduction:</strong></p>
    <p>My name is Min Park</p>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Min Park and as of 2025 I am currently a sophomore
      attending University of Wisconsin-Madison. Since 2015, one of my prominent
      hobbies has been
      <span style="font-weight: bolder; text-decoration: underline"
        >speedcubing</span
      >.
      <span style="font-weight: bolder; text-decoration: underline"
        >Speedcubing</span
      >
      refers to a practice of solving rubik’s cube as quick as possible; you may
      have seen from youtube videos of some people solving 3x3 cubes in as fast
      as 3 seconds, and in fact, the current WR of 3.08 seconds have been set
      this very month (February 2025).
      <span style="font-weight: bolder; text-decoration: underline"
        >Speedcubing</span
      >
      is widely recognized as a respectable hobby sport, and official
      competitions are held at regular intervals throughout the world. While I’m
      nowhere near countless other better speedcubers than me out there, I still
      do consider myself as an adept one. For reference, my current personal
      best is 8 seconds, and I normally average around 12 seconds. Now, if you
      happen to be no speedcuber - and ever had sought solving the standard 3x3
      Rubik’s cube by yourself for the first time, you are in the right place.
      While there are numerous methods for solving 3x3 cubes out there, the
      current most popular method is the
      <span style="text-decoration: underline">CFOP method</span>
      developed around 1981(which is also the one I use). In this website, I
      plan to walk you through the beginner version of the CFOP method in terms
      of learning, and efficiency. While the actual CFOP method is naturally far
      more complex, learning this beginner’s version should easily pave you the
      way to advancing towards the real version, and above all, give you the
      satisfaction of solving your first cube. The tutorials will mainly consist
      of an image showing the ultimate goal of a specific step in the method,
      and a following video explaining how. I’m certainly not the most eloquent
      tutor, but I hope I will have delivered enough information and intuition
      for you to understand in one go. In a nutshell,
      <span style="font-weight: bolder; text-decoration: underline"
        >speedcubing</span
      >
      is no magic - it is really nothing but a train of thought involving
      <span style="font-style: italic"
        >memorizations of algorithms and pattern recognition.</span
      >
      So, if you are still at all interested in this, be an aspiring learner,
      and let us begin by clicking the first link that introduces you to the
      most fundamental step of this method : Cross.
