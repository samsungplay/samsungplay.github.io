              In this step of the cube, the ultimate goal is to complete the
              yellow side of the cube ( in technical terms, this is called OLL,
              a shorthand for orient last layer. ).

              Once you have completed the yellow cross, there are a total of 7
              cases you can encounter. For each of these 7 cases, there is a
              corresponding algorithm with which you can solve the yellow side.
              Examine the shaped formed by yellow colors(stickers) of the cube,
              then execute the corresponding algorithm:
